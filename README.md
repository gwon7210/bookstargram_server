## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Book Search API

The server exposes `GET /books/search`, which proxies the [Naver Book Search](https://developers.naver.com/docs/serviceapi/search/book/book.md) open API.

- `query` (required): search keyword.
- `start` (optional): positive integer that indicates the start index (defaults to `1`).
- `display` (optional): positive integer that controls how many results are returned per page (defaults to Naver's `10` and is capped by Naver at `100`).

Example:

```bash
curl -G "http://localhost:3000/books/search" \
  --data-urlencode "query=클린코드"
```

The response mirrors Naver's payload, so you receive `total`, `display`, `start`, and the `items` array that contains each book entry.

## Environment variables

Store external API keys in your local `.env` file (already git-ignored) so they do not get checked into source control. Add the following entries with the credentials issued from Naver:

```bash
NAVER_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

The application loads `.env` automatically via Nest's `ConfigModule`, so once those values exist you can simply run `npm run start:dev` and the credentials will be available at runtime. In production, inject those values via your deployment platform's secret manager (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Vercel/Render project secrets, etc.) so the process reads them from `process.env` without ever committing them to the repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
